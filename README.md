# TEXT-TO-SPEECH

ðŸ’«what! Coding can be this simple?" 

Today, a friend casually dropped a gem: 

"You can convert text to speech with just three lines of code." (In Script Tag)

Yes, you heard that right. Just type a sentence in a box, and boomâ€”it's spoken aloud. I tried it, and it worked like magic. 

This tiny script sparked something big in me. It was fun and it was powerful.
Fueled by curiosity, I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


Hereâ€™s my showcaseâ€”proof that even a small spark can ignite a coding journey. And trust me, Iâ€™m more excited than ever to level up from minor scripts to
major innovations in this space!
